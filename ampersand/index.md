title: Ampersand Linking Project
---

The purpose of this project is to provide hams with a simple to integrate
a radio with the [AllStarLink](https://www.allstarlink.org) network. There
are well documented ways to get on AllStarLink using the [ASL3](https://allstarlink.github.io/) package and
the Asterisk open-source PBX. Asterisk is a large system intended
for a broad set of telephony applications. As such, it can be hard to configure
and hard to enhance.
