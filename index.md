* [An implementation of the AllStar VOIP linking protocol](ampersand). This
is one of the more ambitious radio software projects I've taken on. This
builds on what was learned from [Microlink](https://github.com/brucemack/microlink) to produce a similar system for AllStar.
* [My submission to the Tiny Tapeout 07](https://github.com/brucemack/tt07-sb-mixer) VLSI chip fabrication project. I created a double balanced mixer.
  * [This page](https://github.com/brucemack/tt07-sb-mixer/blob/main/docs/math.md) contains some details on the math.
* The [MicroLink Project](https://github.com/brucemack/microlink) is 
a from-scratch implementation of an EchoLink station on a $6 microcontroller.
* [A fixed-point C implementation of the GSM-0610 Full Rate audio CODEC](https://github.com/brucemack/gsm-0610-codec). This is the original CODEC used in the 2G mobile telephone network in Europe. It is also used by EchoLink.
* The [LoRA Birdhouse Mesh Network Project](https://github.com/brucemack/WARS-Birdhouse) is a low-power mesh network that runs on LoRA radios.
   - Covered by the [Blind Hams PodCast Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOdMGnqepk)
   - This project is mentioned in an excellent new book called [Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Networks-Radical-Technology-Sourcebook/dp/1944860657) written by Dr. Lori Emerson, Associate Professor of Media Studies, Founding Director of the Media Archaeology Lab, and Director of the Intermedia Art, Writing and Performance Program at the University of Colorado Boulder. I was flattered that Dr. Emerson considered this technology to be "radical" enough to be included in her book, but it's probably not as radical as some of the other technologies she describes including a faster-than-light communications network and a pasilalinic-sympathetic compass.
* A [hardware/software interface to the ODB2 vehicle diagnostic connector](https://github.com/brucemack/hello-obd2) on your car.
  * [More detail on the hardware](https://github.com/brucemack/iso9141-interface)
* The [NanoVNA Controller Project](https://github.com/brucemack/nanovna-controller) is an HTML interface for the NanoVNA vector 
network analyzer.  
  * This was covered by the [Blind Hams PodCast Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btvXQv5VkKs&t=336) given the accessibility
  aspects of this project.
* I wrote a [study guide for the FCC Ship Radar Endorsement Exam](https://www.amazon.com/Radar-Endorsement-Quick-Study-Guide/dp/B0CGL9TC46)
  * See also, some [possible Errata on the FCC Exam](fcc-element8/questions.html)
