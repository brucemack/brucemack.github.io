## Some Interesting Projects

* [My submission to the Tiny Tapeout 07](https://github.com/brucemack/tt07-sb-mixer) VLSI chip fabrication project. I created a double balanced mixer.
  * [This page](https://github.com/brucemack/tt07-sb-mixer/blob/main/docs/math.md) contains some details on the math.
* The [MicroLink Project](https://github.com/brucemack/microlink) is 
a from-scratch implementation of an EchoLink station on a $6 microcontroller.
* [A fixed-point C implementation of the GSM-0610 Full Rate audio CODEC](https://github.com/brucemack/gsm-0610-codec). This is the original CODEC used in the 2G mobile telephone network in Europe. It is also used by EchoLink.
* The [LoRA Birdhouse Mesh Network Project](https://github.com/brucemack/WARS-Birdhouse) is a low-power mesh network that runs on LoRA radios.
   * Covered by the [Blind Hams PodCast Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOdMGnqepk)
* A [hardware/software interface to the ODB2 vehicle diagnostic connector](https://github.com/brucemack/hello-obd2) on your car.
  * [More detail on the hardware](https://github.com/brucemack/iso9141-interface)
* The [NanoVNA Controller Project](https://github.com/brucemack/nanovna-controller) is an HTML interface for the NanoVNA vector 
network analyzer.  
  * This was covered by the [Blind Hams PodCast Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btvXQv5VkKs&t=336) due to the project's 
  applicability to allow a NanoVNA to be accessed using a screen reader.
* I wrote a [study guide for the FCC Ship Radar Endorsement Exam](https://www.amazon.com/Radar-Endorsement-Quick-Study-Guide/dp/B0CGL9TC46)
  * See also, some [possible Errata on the FCC Exam](fcc-element8/questions.html)
