I've been experimenting with this module. The datasheets are lacking a bit. Here 
are my notes.

The module has a power range of 3.3 to 5.5V (Vdd). When powered from a +5V
supply the logic I/Os including TXD, RXD, PTT, and AFSQ all operate using
3.3V logic. So there is no level-shifting required to communicate with 
the module from a 3.3V controller.

# Audio Input

A 10mVpp signal generator (HiZ) at 1 kHz gives a good tone on a receiver.

# FM Deviation Measurement

Here we use the Bessel null method to evaluate the deviation of the module.

Module is keyed with no audio input and the carrier is centered. 

![Deviation2](../assets/images/deviation-PNG2.png)

Tone magnitude is set to 30mVpp and frequency to 1.5kHz. We see the expected sidebands appear:

![Deviation3](../assets/images/deviation-PNG3.png)

Tone frequency is reduced to 1.0kHz. We see the carrier start to diminish relative to the sidebands.

![Deviation4](../assets/images/deviation-PNG4.png)

Frequency is adjusted until the carrier is at the noise floor, about 850 Hz:

![Deviation5](../assets/images/deviation-PNG5.png)

Since the carrier's first null will happen with a modulation index of 2.4, we can compute the deviation:

        Δf = deviation • modulation_frequency

So the deviation is 2,040 Hz.

# Programming/Commands

[Programming Guide](https://www.qsl.net/ta2ei/devreler/sa818/SA818%20programming%20manual.pdf)

IMPORTANT: The characters that make up a command (including the trailing CR/LF)
need to be sent in one batch. There is obviously some kind of internal timeout
that generates an error state if there is any delay between characters.
So **connecting a terminal emulator and typing commands
interactively into the module (at human speed) won't work.**

The examples in the programming guide notwithstanding, the frequencies must be
specified with 4 digits to the right of the decimal point.
