I've been experimenting with this module. Here are my notes.

The module has a power range of 3.3 to 5.5V (Vdd). When powered from a +5V
supply the logic I/Os including TXD, RXD, PTT, and AFSQ all operate using
+3.3V logic. So there is no level-shifting required.

# Audio Input

A 10mVpp signal generator (HiZ) at 1 kHz gives a good tone on a receiver.

[Programming Guide](https://www.qsl.net/ta2ei/devreler/sa818/SA818%20programming%20manual.pdf)

IMPORTANT: The characters that make up a command (including the trailing CR/LF)
need to be sent in one batch. There is obviously some kind of internal timeout
that generates an error state if there is any delay between characters.
**Connecting a terminal emulator and typing commands
interactively (at human speed) won't work.**

The examples in the programming guide notwithstanding, the frequencies must be
specified with 4 digits to the right of the decimal point.
