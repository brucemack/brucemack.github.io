title: Notes on the Shari SA818 Module

These are my nodes on the Shari SA818 module in the context of All Star Link. I hear
a lot of negative comments about the quality of this device.  Or, to be fair, the 
quality of the imitations being sold on the internet. But there are many ASL stations
based on some variation of the Shari board so it's important to have good integration 
for [Ampersand](https://mackinnon.info/ampersand).

Please see [my SA818 page](https://mackinnon.info/2025/10/07/sa818-module.html) for 
information about the radio module itself. 

Heres [a schematic](https://www.lyonscomputer.com.au/Allstarlink/AllStarLink-Builds/VK4PK-ASL-SHARI-Build/VK4PK-ASL-SHARI-Build.html#schematic) for one
variation of this device.

The board contains a [CM108](https://www.mpja.com/download/36814cp%20cm108%20data.pdf)
for audio input/output.

CM108 input signals:

* The SA818 SQ signal is connected to the CM108 VOLDN pin. This is consistent with the 
usual convention: COS -> VOLDN.

CM108 output signals:

* The SA818 PTT signal is connected to the CM108 GPIO3. This
pin is mapped to HID_OR1 in the 0b00000100 bit position. This can only be written when 
HID_OR0 0b11000000 is set to 0. For reasons that aren't clear to me (and not consistent
with the datasheet), turning on GPI03 requires a 5-byte write { 0, 0, 0x4, 0x4, 0 } and
turning it off requires a 5-bute write { 0, 0, 0x04, 0x00, 0 }. The first 0x04 is tbe 
mask that sets GPI03 as output and the second 0x4 is the "high" signal or the "low" 
signal.
