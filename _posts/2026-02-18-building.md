title: The Benefits of Wheel Reinvention

I'm working on a [pretty elaborate VOIP project](https://mackinnon.info/ampersand/) right now and 
someone on the AllStarLink forum questioned why I was spending so 
much time "reinventing the wheel." It's a good question, and certainly
relevant given how much of my life has been spent reinventing various
wheels, axles, transmissions, breaking systems, and other previously proven 
technologies.

In my experience, the best way to **really** understand a technology is to 
try to implement it yourself. You can read the books, take the classes,
and watch the YouTube videos, but there is no substitute 
for sitting in front of a blank screen and trying to copy some existing 
capability with your own hands. There are
100's of subtle details lurking below the surface of a system of modest
complexity, none of which can be appreciated (let alone understood) by simply watching the highlight reel.
Not to mention the AI summarization ...

A time-honored training method used by artists is called 
the "Master Copy" in which the aspiring student attempts to 
reproduce a great masterwork. "Art begets art," says [Daniel Graves](https://danielgravesart.com/), 
a well-known painter and founder of the Florence Academy of Art, "and
nothing is more useful for an art student than to copy a great 
master painting." Supposedly Chopin began his piano practice every day with 
some preludes and fugues from Bach's 48. I spent two weeks in 
Maine last summer at the [The Wooden Boat School](https://www.thewoodenboatschool.com/) where a bunch of us spent 
hours a day in the shop trying to accurately reproduce a 
wooden dory designed by George L. Chaisson, the legendary 
builder from 
the north shore of Massachusetts. 

There is something about the 
process of replicating the work of the great masters that prepares
your hands to do great work of your own.
