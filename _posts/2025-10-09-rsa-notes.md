These notes are written with a focus on the Asterisk
(IAX2) implementation. 

Official standard used in IAX2 is: PKCS#1 V2.0 for RSA 
(RFC 2437). 




## Notes on PKCS#1 (RFC 3447)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_1

### Converting a Message to an Integer: OS2IP (RFC 3447 section 4.2)

The OS2IP function interprets the byte string as a big-endian representation of an integer. Each byte in the message is treated as a 
digit in a base-256 numbering system. The first byte
in the message becomes the most significant part of
the integer.

### Representation of Public Key

Two fields:
    * The RSA modulus n.
    * The RSA public exponent e.
