These notes are written with a focus on the Asterisk
(IAX2) implementation. 

Official standard used in IAX2 is: PKCS#1 V2.0 for RSA 
(RFC 2437). 

## Notes on PKCS#1 V2.0 (RFC 2437)

### Representation of Public Key

Two fields:
    * The RSA modulus n.
    * The RSA public exponent e.

### Encoding (and Padding) the Message: EME-PKCS1-v1_5

NOTE: "Encoding" here doesn't mean encrypting. This is the process of 
converting the bytes of the message into something that can converted
to an integer.

* M is the original message.
* k is the length of the modulus (n) in octets.
* Message length can be up to k-11 octets. Padding is used to make up for any shortfall.
* The encoded message EM ends up being k-1 octets long.
* The padding process must add at least 8 octets of padding consisting of pseudorandomly generated nonzero octets. The pad is called PS. 
* The encoded message will look like this:

        EM = 02 || PS || 00 || M

### Converting a Message to an Integer: OS2IP (RFC 2437 section 4.2)

The OS2IP function interprets the byte string as a big-endian representation of an integer. Each byte in the message is treated as a 
digit in a base-256 numbering system. The first byte
in the message becomes the most significant part of
the integer.

### Verification (RSAVP1)

A verification primitive recovers the message representative from the
signature representative under the control of the corresponding
public key.
