title: One Way North - Hiking the Vermont Long Trail
---
I recently completed a northbound thru hike of the Vermont Long Trail. This
page provides notes on my experience in case it helps others. There are 
already many good travel logs of the Long Trail out there, mostly in video
format. Instead of providing yet another day-by-day account of the trail, I'm 
treating this page more like a how-to guide.

There are many ways to have a successful thru-hike of the Long Trail. Here I 
document *one* way that worked for me. I'm certainly not claiming that this
is the only way, or even the best way to hike the Trail. This is just one way
that worked for a 57 year-old man in reasonably good physical condition and with 
some basic backpacking experience.

General Overview
----------------

The Long Trail follows the Green Mountains of Vermont from the Massachusetts border
to the Canadian border. The Trail is 273 miles long and experiences about 65,000 feet
of elevation gain. I started the hike on Tuesday, August 5 and ended on Saturday, August 30 2025. I started on the Route 2 crossing of the AT in North Adams, MA and spent my first 
night on the AT in Massachusetts, so technically my LT hike required 24 days.

Physical Training
-----------------

A hike of this magnitude requries a lot of physical training, particularly if you 
want to enjoy it. I started off in reasonably good shape, but my preparation started 
about a year before I stepped onto the trail in North Adams. Key elements of the 
training:
* I walked 5-12 miles every day for a year leading up to the hike. No weights, although
that would probably help. The longer days were often made up of two walks, one in early
morning and one in the evening before dinner.
* I did basic weight training at a local gym for about 6 months prior to the hike. Push (arms), pull (arms), legs every other day. Weight training is the most effective step 
you can take to avoid injury on a long-distance hiking trip.
* My wife and I walked the West Highland Way in Scotland 3 months prior to the trip. This 
was a ~100 mile trip in 6 days with two >20 mile days. This *was not* a back-packing 
trip and the 
terain was much easier than the Green Mountains of Vermont, however it was very helpful 
to get used to walking for multiple consecutive days (some in the pouring rain) without 
rest in between. I also 
liked the chance to test my socks/shoes to make sure that blisters weren't going to be
an issue.
* I lost about 25 pounds during this process and got to a BMI target of 24. Coincidentally
(or not), my pack weight was around 25 pounds. Anyone who plans to spent a lot of time/money
getting into "ultralight" should first make sure that they are <= 24 BMI.

Gear
----

There is already plenty of material on the internet about LT packing list so 
I'm not going to list out all of my gear - reach out if you care. Suffice to say, 
I am not a ultra-light hiker and I can say that with confidence after seeing some 
actual ultra-light hikers on the trail. From my experience, my base weight of ~20 
pounds put me in the middle of the range of hikers I met along the way. Many had
lighter packs and many had heavier. I doubt that 5 pounds more or less
would have made much of a difference in my success/enjoyment.

My "big three" consisted of:
* Hyperlite Mountain Gear 55L Southwest pack (black)
* Big Agnes Copper Spur UL-1 tent
* Enlighted Equipment Revelation 20 quilt
* Therm-a-Rest NeoAir NextLite NXT

Footwear
--------

I wore Topo Athletic Pursuit 2 shoes, Injingi sock liners, and Darn Tough quarter length socks. I was very happy with this combination, particularly the traction provided by 
the Topo shoes. Maybe I was seduced by the marketing, but I'm a huge fan of the
wide toe-box and zero drop combination. 

I often hear people say that they feel the need to wear hiking boots or some other 
type of shoe that provides them with more "ankle support." I'm not a doctor, but I 
strongly suspect that 
anyone who thinks that their foot health depends on the height of their shoes *should 
not hike the Long Trail.* The terain is insanely rough and, when push comes to shove, your shoes are not going 
to provide any significant support. Instead, take a another year of training using a 
combination of weight training and elastic "theraband" training. When you feel comforable
hiking on challening terain wearing normal walking shoes you are ready to go. Before that, 
you are probably an injury waiting to happen.

Resupply/Stops
--------------

I made 6 town stops:
* Bennington, in and out to pick up a box at the PO and have lunch.
* Manchester, NERO and an overnight at the Hampton Inn.
* Killington, NERO and an overnight at the North Star.
* Warren, NERO and an overnight at the West Hill House B&B.
* Waterbury, NERO and a ZERO at the Old Stagecoach Inn.
* Johnson, in and out to resupply and have lunch.

I was happy with this plan. I had one day (Waterbury) with no hiking, but this was essential.
The in-town meals were very important to address the inevitable calorie deficit that
you experience on the trail.

Pace/Itinary 
-------------

I've attached my itinary in case you're interested. It's probably not possible to 
pre-define your exact itinary on the LT because of different variables that may come 
up. My philosophy boiled down to the following:
* Never go more than 9 miles in the first week. More on this below.
* Pay attention to the elevation gains and dial back mileage as needed. I only had 
a few days that involved more than 4,000 feet of ascent. Any day that has more than 
700 ft/mile of ascent is going to be very hard.
* Be flexible around Camel's Hump and Mt. Mansfield to avoid exposure in bad weather. 
There are bad weather blue-blazes that can be used if you need to say on schedule 
and don't want to cross the dangerously exposed peaks. However, steep slippery 
down sections need to be taken extremely slowly.

Walking
-------

You'll be waling a lot, right? A few things about my walking philosophy:
* I set my alarm so that I was standing on the trail when it becomes light
enough to hike safely without a light. In August that's about 6:00 AM.
* I try to stop hiking between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM (August).
* Personal preference: I liked to get up, pack up, and start hiking before
eating breakfast. I stop for a hot breakfast somewhere between 2-4 miles down 
the trail, generally at a good water source and ideally at a swimmable location.
I find that overlapping the first break with breakfast is efficient and tricks
your body into getting the first few miles "for free."
* I never hiked with a headlight. Headlight hiking should be 
for emergencies only. Scheduled night hikes to push miles is asking for trouble
in my view.

Communications/Electronics
--------------------------

I carried an iPhone 16 (Verizon). I was able to text/call
home at least a few times a day, from higher elevations. Many shelters had
at least one bar of Verizon coverage. 

I also carried a Garmin Inreach Mini 2 to send check-in messages every night to fill 
in those places where mobile coverage was weak. The Garmin was paired with my iPhone
to support text messages and to receive weather forecasts when needed.

I carried a Nitecore NU25 (USB-C) headlamp.

I carried an Anker 10,000 mAh power bank with a USB-C cable and small charging block.

I kept my iPhone in low-power and airplane modes, used my phone sparingly and traveled with my Garmin Inreach off at all times. I never came close to running out of power.

Navigation
----------

I used the ubiquitous Farout app on my iPhone. I also copied the 12 division maps from the Long Trail guide onto waterproof paper and carried the relevant page in my pocket.  Having 
the paper map provided a good safety backup and made it easy to check progress without constantly using my phone. 

Farout is essential for a few purposes:
* Getting commentary on water sources - particularly in drought years like the one I experienced.
* Getting commentary on tent capactiy at shelter sites.
* Getting phone numbers of shelters/inns on the trail.
* Helping to recover in those few places where I lost the trail. It's great to know whether
you are to the left or the right of the trail, particularly in those places where the 
trail "mistakes" are well-worn.
