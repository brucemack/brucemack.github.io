title: One Way North - My Hike of the Vermont Long Trail
---
I recently completed a northbound thru hike of the Vermont Long Trail. This
page provides notes on my experience in case it helps others. There are 
many good travel logs by Long Trail hikers out there, mostly in video
format. Instead of providing yet another day-by-day account of the trail, I'm 
treating this page like a how-to guide.

There are many ways to have a successful thru hike of the Long Trail. Here I 
document *one way that worked for me*. I'm certainly not claiming that this
is the only way, or even the best way to hike the Trail. This is just one way
that worked for a 57 year-old first-time thru-hiker in reasonably good physical 
condition and with some basic backpacking experience. 

You may come up with a much better way. Hike your own hike!

General Overview
----------------

The Long Trail follows the Green Mountains of Vermont from the Massachusetts border
to the Canadian border. The Trail is 273 miles long and requires about 65,000 feet
of elevation gain. I started my hike on Tuesday, August 5 and ended on Saturday, August 30, 2025. I started at the Route 2 crossing of the AT in North Adams, MA and spent my first 
night on the AT in Massachusetts, so technically my LT hike required 24 days. I took one
zero.

I averaged around 11 miles per day with a range of around 5 miles on the short end to a few long days of ~17 miles.

My Training
-----------

A hike of this magnitude requires a lot of physical training, particularly if you 
want to enjoy the trip. I started off in reasonably good shape, but my preparation started 
about a year before I stepped onto the trail in North Adams. Key elements of my 
training:
* I walked 5-12 miles every day for a year leading up to the hike.  My longer training days were often made up of two walks, one in early
morning and one in the evening before dinner.
* I did basic weight training at a local gym for about 6 months prior to the hike. I 
used weights every other day and rotated through push (arms), pull (arms), and legs. You 
will use your arms a lot on this trip so don't neglect that part of your training. In my view, weight training is the most effective step 
you can take to avoid injury on a long-distance hiking trip, especially for us older folks.
* My wife and I walked the West Highland Way in Scotland 3 months prior to the trip. This 
was a ~100 mile trip in 6 days with two >20 mile days. This *was not* a backpacking 
trip and the 
terrain was much easier than the Green Mountains of Vermont, however it was very helpful 
to get used to walking for multiple consecutive days (some in the pouring rain) without 
days off in between. I also 
liked the chance to test my socks/shoes and to make sure that blisters weren't going to be
an issue. You don't need to go to an exotic location to have a training hike like this, 
just be sure to hike multiple long days **consecutively** to get used to that experience.
* I lost about 25 pounds during the training process and got to a BMI target of 24. Coincidentally
(or not), my pack weight was around 25 pounds. Anyone who plans to spend a lot of time/money
getting into "ultralight" gear should first make sure that they are <=24 BMI.

I completed the hike, I didn't get injured, and I had very little soreness along the way.
Yes, my legs were very tired every night.

Time of Year
------------

I hiked in August. I think August is a good compromise between weather (i.e. not too
cold, reasonably dry) and low bugs.

Another side-benefit of August on the LT is that you start directly in the midst
of the NOBO and SOBO AT bubbles. This provides access to trail expertise and 
camaraderie during
the early days of your LT hike. I met some very nice AT hikers and they taught me a lot (esp: Yellow Shoes, Knots, Swede, Tee Time, 62, Chef, Early Bird, Tagless).

By the time you pass Maine Junction north of Killington and the AT folks take a right
towards New Hampshire you will be well trained. The LT crowd is much thinner, but I 
never had a case where I was alone in a shelter.

One thing worth mentioning here is that the relatively large AT "bubble" I experienced
in early August included a surprising number of weed smokers. I've got no problem with 
people "hiking their own hikes" (so long as they aren't bothering others and keep it 
away from the shelters) and I think
this might actually be legal in Vermont, so I share this only so that others won't be 
too surprised when they encounter smokers on the trail. For what it's worth, it seemed 
to be younger AT NOBOs partaking in this particular recreation. Not so much amongst 
the AT SOBOs, and I never saw it again after I passed north of the Maine Junction where 
the LT and AT split. 

Pace/Itinerary 
--------------

[I've attached my itinerary here](/assets/lt2025.pdf) in case you're interested. It's probably not possible to 
pre-define your exact itinerary on the LT because of different variables that may come 
up. I planned conservatively and ended on the day I had originally targeted.

I hiked northbound. LT SOBO hikers are a bit crazy in my view, but I have huge
respect for that added challenge. SOBO would not be 
a good idea for a beginner. You need the easy miles in the south to prepare
for the brutal miles in the north.

My itinerary philosophy boiled down to the following:
* Average around 8 and never go more than 12 miles a day in the first week. More on 
this below.
* Pay attention to the elevation profile and dial back mileage as needed. I only had 
a few days that involved more than 4,000 feet of ascent. Any day that has more than 
700 ft/mile of ascent is going to be very hard.
* Be flexible around Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield to avoid exposure in bad weather. 
There are bad weather blue-blazes that can be used if you need to stay on schedule 
and don't want to cross the dangerously exposed peaks. However, steep slippery 
down sections need to be taken extremely slowly, even on the bad-weather bypasses. I 
was lucky and had perfect weather for Camel's Hump and good enough weather for Mansfield 
so no bad-weather bypasses were needed.
* Sometimes blue-blazes are needed to see the best views (Killington, Belvedere for example), factor those miles into your plans and take it easy coming down.

Walking
-------

You're ready to walk a lot, right? A few things about my walking philosophy:
* I set my alarm for 5:00 AM so that I was standing on the trail when it became light
enough to hike safely. In August that was around 6:00 AM. An early start allows 
you to walk more slowly and take more breaks.
* I forced myself to walk *very slowly* during the first 30 minutes of each morning. This provided a good warmup and reduced the chances of injury.
* I tried to end my hiking day between 3:30 PM and 5:00 PM (August).
* Personal preference: I liked to get up, pack up, and start hiking before
eating breakfast. I stopped for a hot breakfast somewhere between 2-4 miles down 
the trail, generally at a good water source and ideally at a swimmable location.
I found that overlapping my first break with breakfast was efficient and tricked
my body into getting the first few miles "for free."
* Personal preference: I liked to get into camp on the earlier side and get
first crack at selecting a flat tent site.
* I never hiked with a headlight. Headlight hiking should be 
for emergencies only. Scheduling night hikes to push more miles is asking for trouble
in my view.
* I used hiking poles. This is critical to protect your knees. There were also 
some down sections that I'm not sure I could have navigated without poles. 
* I only had three falls. In my experience, if I found myself tripping 
much this meant that (a) I was tired and/or under-caloried and should stop for a 
snack break (b) I was moving too quickly (c) I was not focused on my footing. I heard some people on the trail
talking/bragging about how often they were falling during the trip - my guess is that those
people were hiking too fast.
* Walking on rough terrain requires focus to avoid injury. Don't multi-task. If you need 
to check your map, stop.  If you need to take a drink, stop.
If you need to text a shuttle driver, stop.
* Don't underestimate the fall danger on blue-blazes or around water sources. Bring your
poles and use caution even when you're not on the main line! Some of the most dangerous/slippery places I encountered were around awkward water sources.
* Blow-downs are common on some sections of the trail. For large/complex blow-downs,
I found that the faster I took off my pack, the faster I was through the blow-down. It
can be tempting to resist this and attempt to navigate a large blow-down while wearing a
pack, but I often got stuck and ended up wasting more time than I saved.

Start Slow
----------

You've already heard this advice many times, so I don't need to belabor the point. The most 
common problem that I saw on the trail was repetitive stress injury. And
most of the time this involved hikers who had started making big miles early in their
trip. I kept my daily milage under 12 for the first week of the trip to avoid this 
problem.

All of the AT hikers that I met on the first few days of my trip (they were around mile
1,600) shared the same advice with me: **start slow**.

This is a difficult limit to enforce, especially in the first few days of the hike. When
you roll up to a shelter at 2:00 PM feeling great it's hard to resist the temptation to 
keep hiking. Trust me, just stop. I brought a book with me on the first part of the trip
and it provided something to fill the down time and reduced the temptation to press to another
shelter.

You'll meet some nice AT hikers and will likely want to hike with them. Keep in mind that 
these folks have been hiking for multiple months and have covered >1,600 miles. Don't 
pace yourself against seasoned hikers during the first few days of your hike. Start slow.

Mental Approach
---------------

A lot of people talk about the mental challenge of long-distance hiking trips. After
doing something like this for almost a month I can attest that it is a mental challenge.
A few points that may be helpful in this regard:
* I suspect that most people who say they are struggling mentally are really just
tired, sore, and hungry. Take your physical preparation seriously, take it slow, rest
when you need it, and carry enough calories. You'll be fine.
* Take the hike one 1/2 day at a time. I sometimes became overwhelmed when I started to 
think/plan too far down the track. Just get yourself to the next shelter safely and 
efficiently. You'll be fine.
* Sometimes I met people hiking in the opposite direction who shared scary-sounding
descriptions of upcoming trail features. Very often these descriptions turned out to be 
over-blown. Don't dwell much on other hikers' trail descriptions, particularly fear-mongering - everyone experiences the trail
differently. We've all heard about "type-2 fun" (i.e. things that were hard at the time,
but seemed very fun in retrospect), but I think there is also a phenomenon like "type-2
horror" when things that really weren't *that* hard in the moment seem very difficult in retrospect. And it may actually be fun/stress-relieving to talk about how incredibly difficult things were. Don't get stressed out, you'll be fine.
* Keep in mind that everything about the journey is impermanent. All torrential rain storms 
and all ridiculously steep climbs will pass. You'll be fine.
* No matter how much of an introvert you are (like me), **the people you meet along 
the trail are a blessing.** Stop and talk to other hikers. Even if you are a tenter, make a point of introducing yourself 
to everyone else at the shelter. Eat dinner with the group. This will greatly improve
your mental state. You'll be fine.

The thought of not finishing the Trail never entered my mind.

Resupply/Town Stops
-------------------

I made 6 town stops:
* Bennington, in and out to pick up a box at the PO and to have lunch at the [Madison Brewing Company](https://www.madisonbrewingco.com/).
* Manchester, NERO and an overnight at the Hampton Inn.
* Killington, NERO and an overnight at the [North Star Lodge](https://www.northstarinn.com/). Lunch at the [Inn at Long Trail](https://innatlongtrail.com/). (NOTE: The name notwithstanding, this inn **is not** on the 
Long Trail, but rather is on
a blue-blaze coming down from Killington. The walk east on VT4 to the 
inn takes about 25 minutes and is worthwhile). I would have stayed at the Inn if 
there were rooms available.
* Warren, NERO and an overnight at the outstanding [West Hill House B&B](https://westhillbb.com/).
* Waterbury, NERO and a ZERO at the outstanding [Old Stagecoach Inn](https://oldstagecoach.com/). Lunch at [McGillicuddy](https://mcgillicuddyswaterbury.com/) and [Maxis](https://www.maxisrestaurant.com/), dinner 
at [Blackback](https://www.theblackbackpub.com/).
* Johnson, in and out to resupply at the [Johnson Hardware Store](https://jhrvt.com/) and to have lunch at the [Maplefields](https://maplefields.com/).

I was happy with this plan. I only had one day off with no hiking (Waterbury), but this 
zero day was essential for physical and mental recovery, particularly between Camel's Hump
and Mount Mansfield.

I did my laundry at all town stops except Bennington and Johnson.

The **in-town meals were very important** to address the inevitable calorie deficit that
you experience on the trail. Take your time, relax, and eat a lot.

One thing I learned from busy town road crossings is that you may encounter a ride
opportunity faster than you expect. I found it helpful to have my money/credit cards, 
Garmin, and phone assembled into my electronics dry bag (and in hand) just prior to 
exiting the woods. It's good peace of mind to have these things with you if/when you get 
separated from your pack as it gets thrown into a trunk or the back of a pickup truck
on the side of a busy road.
There are a lot of nice people living near these trail towns and I was constantly
surprised by the help I received. 

Gear
----

I'm not a big gear nerd and there is already plenty of material on the internet about LT packing lists so 
I'm not going to list out all of my gear.  Reach out if you care. Suffice to say, 
I am not an ultra-light hiker and I say that with confidence after seeing some 
**actual** ultra-light hikers on the trail. From my experience, my base weight of ~20 
pounds put me in the middle of the range of hikers I met along the way. Many had
lighter packs and many had heavier. Lighter is better for sure, but I doubt that 
5 pounds more or less would have made much of a difference in my success/enjoyment.

My "big three" consisted of:
* Hyperlite Mountain Gear 55L Southwest pack (black). This is the most durable 
version of the HMG packs, which is important given the amount of times you'll 
scrape/snag your pack on rocks and trees on the LT. Yes, it's a bit heavier.
I used the standard contractor-bag to keep things dry inside and did not
use a pack cover. I never had a problem with things getting wet, even 
during a few bad rain storms.
* Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1 free-standing tent. I'm 5' 11" and found the 
1-person to be comfortable. I kept my pack outside under the "vestibule" and
it stayed dry, even through a few bad rain storms. I used the trekking pole
vestibule configuration twice when I needed to cook in rainy conditions and 
that worked fine. I brought a few short pieces of paracord which were useful 
for (a) clotheslines inside the tent or (b) anchoring tent corners when pitching on 
wooden platforms.
* 6x9 Tyvek sheet ground cover.
* Enlightened Equipment Revelation 20 quilt
* A silk sleeping bag liner
* Therm-a-Rest NeoAir NextLite NXT sleeping pad. Comfortable enough, and not too loud.
* Gossamer Gear 1/8" foam pad -  particularly important for protecting your 
fragile sleeping pad from shelter floors. Also a great sit/nap pad.

I was happy with all gear selections and wouldn't change anything.

I see a lot of people online obsessing about UL and pack weights. As my 
wise son pointed out before one of our trips, it might be more productive to improve
your diet and loose 5 pounds off your body than to figure out how to 
loose 5 pounds from your pack.

Footwear
--------

I wore Topo Athletic Pursuit 2 shoes, Injingi sock liners, and Darn Tough quarter length socks. I was very happy with this combination, particularly the traction provided by 
the Topo shoes. Maybe I was seduced by the marketing, but I'm a huge fan of the
wide toe-box and zero drop combination. 

I often hear people say that they feel the need to wear hiking boots or some other 
type of high shoe that provides more "ankle support." I'm not a doctor, but I 
strongly suspect that 
anyone who thinks that their foot health depends on the height of their shoes **should probably not be hiking on the Long Trail.** The terrain is insanely rough and, when push comes to shove, your shoes are not going 
to provide any significant ankle protection against the uneven, steep, muddy, rocky, rooty, blown-down, 
tangled treadway that is the LT.
Instead, take a another few months of prep using a 
combination of weight training and elastic "Theraband" training. When you feel confident
hiking on challenging terrain wearing normal trail-running sneakers you are ready to go. Before that, 
you are probably an injury waiting to happen. Of course, if you wear a certain kind of 
boot/shoe because it's comfortable for you that's what you should wear.

NOTE: My characterization of the LT trail conditions is not meant to be a criticism
of the GMC trail maintainers. To the contrary, the trail is very well maintained.
At the same time, the trail is very rugged in many places.

Clothing
--------

This isn't comprehensive, but a few notes on the frequently asked items:
* I hiked in shorts 100% of the time, I didn't bring long pants.
* I used my rain pants for warmth in the evenings and mornings about 5 times.
* I wore my sun hoodie in the morning on the trail a few times, but dropped
to a normal t-shirt on the first climb.
* I wore my puffy jacket once on the entire trip (evening on Jay Peak).
* I had a bug net but never used it.

Communications/Electronics
--------------------------

I carried an iPhone 16 (Verizon). I had enough service to text/call
home at least a few times a day, particularly from higher elevations. Many shelters had
at least one bar of Verizon coverage. 

One of the emotional highlights of my trip happened 2 days before the finish 
when I turned on my phone at the top of a modest mountain (Buchanan I think) and
received a text message from Verizon that said: "Welcome to Canada! As talk, text,
and data is included in your domestic plan you'll have no additional charges while roaming."
That told me I was on a Canadian tower and getting close to the border!

I also carried a Garmin inReach Mini 2 to send check-in messages every night. This was
helpful to fill 
in those places where mobile coverage was weak. The Garmin was paired with my iPhone
to support text messages and to receive weather forecasts when needed.

Keep in mind that the Garmin inReach uses the Iridium satellite constellation which
can be slow when there is no clear view of the sky (i.e. leaf-obstructed). I always 
turned on my Garmin 
and broadcast the "Check In" as soon as I reached camp knowing that the message 
could take up to ~30 minutes to be delivered. Sometimes it was much faster.

The latest iPhones have a satellite messaging capability that uses the 
Globalstar constellation. I used this feature when outside of mobile cellular 
range and was surprised to see that it usually worked more quickly than the 
Garmin inReach.

I carried a Nitecore NU25 (USB-C) rechargeable headlamp. Very rugged and efficient.

I carried an Anker 10,000 mAh power bank with a USB-C cable and a small charging block 
for town. I wasn't setup for the high-speed PD charging capability but this didn't matter.

I kept my iPhone in low-power and airplane modes, used my phone sparingly, traveled with my Garmin inReach off at all times, and limited headlight use. I never came close to running out of power on my trip.

I kept my iPhone in a plastic bag and in a velcro front pocket on my shoulder strap. Walking 
with a fragile phone in the pocket of your shorts is probably not a good idea on the 
Long Trail.

Navigation
----------

I used the ubiquitous FarOut app on my iPhone. I also copied the 12 division maps from the Long Trail guide onto waterproof paper and carried the relevant page in my pocket.  Having 
the paper map provided a good safety backup and made it easy to check progress without constantly using my phone. 

FarOut is essential for a few purposes:
* Getting commentary on water sources - particularly in drought years like the one I experienced.
* Getting commentary on tent capacity at shelter sites.
* Getting phone numbers of shuttles/inns on the trail.
* Helping to recover in those few places where I lost the trail. It was great to know 
whether I was to the left or the right of the trail, particularly in those places where 
the trail "mistakes" are well-worn.

Shelters/Tenting
----------------

I carried a tent and used it whenever possible. I slept in shelters 4 nights when tenting
wasn't allowed and/or available (no tenting above 2,500 ft is allowed). The shelter experience was great and I would encourage
everyone to try it at least a few times. Yes, there were mice running around, but 
none bothered me that much. Mice are part of living in the woods.

In my experience the shelters were completely dark/quiet by 8:30 PM. 

Even if you plan to sleep in shelters every night (which is theoretically possible), I 
would suggest carrying some form of alternate shelter. You never know where you're going 
to be stuck out on the trail. I did see some crowded shelters in the south so keep 
the "no room at the inn" scenario in mind.

I slept in stealth tent sites between shelters twice on my trip.

I pitched on wooden platforms about 4 times and on the ground all other times.

Taking some time to select a flat tent spot is worthwhile. The only bad nights I had on 
the trail were caused by overly sloped tent sites. Otherwise, I slept well.

*I met the Tufts University pre-freshman Wilderness Orientation trip at Taft Lodge just off 
Mount Mansfield. A great group - GO JUMBOS!*

Privies
-------

All shelter/tent sites that I stayed at had well-maintained privies. One can only 
imagine how much work must go into this system. To avoid any confusion, none of the
back-country privies have toilet paper - you're responsible for that. There were
a few privies at trailhead parking lots that provided toilet paper, which feels
like quite a luxury when you encounter it.

Water
-----

I carried two Smartwater bottles with me at all times: 1.0L and 700mL. I generally used the 
700mL bottle for hydration on the trail and carried the 1L for back-up and/or camp
when approaching a dry shelter. I tried to limit the full carry of the 1L back-up bottle 
during significant climbs, but that wasn't always possible due to the dry conditions 
in August of 2025.

I swapped the standard Smartwater bottle caps with [these push/pull 28mm caps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6L4LRYY). I liked these caps for a few reasons:
* They are sturdy and eliminate the possibility of loosing a cap.
* They can be closed securely to avoid losing water during those times (more often than
you think) when you are hiking in positions that turn your pack sideways and/or upside down.
* The caps can be opened/closed hands-free, thus limiting the amount of dirty hand 
contact with the part of the bottle that goes in your mouth.

I carried a 2L CNOC bladder which I used for water collection only - I never traveled with
water in the CNOC bladder.

I often used my 750mL Toaks pot to scoop water into the CNOC, particularly in low-flow
sources.

I filtered using a Sawyer Squeeze filter (CNOC->Filter->Blue Coupler->Smartwater Bottle).
I liked this system a lot.

I used a short line to hang my CNOC from a tree during filtering. It was good to 
be able to multi-task while filtering water. The "blue coupler" is essential.

I avoided taking water from streams that were fed by swamps and/or beaver ponds.

I back-flushed the filter at every town stop. I never encountered the "slow filter" 
problem that some people complain about.

I used an electrolyte drink mix (Liquid IV) in my water once per day. I found this 
to be important for muscle cramp reduction.

I hiked in August 2025 during one of the most significant droughts in recent Vermont history. Lake Champlain reached a low water level not seen since 1934 during my hike. Several of the 
"reliable" water sources were dry. I was fairly conservative with my water carries 
and never had a major problem. Key things to remember during drought conditions:
* Talk with all SOBOs to get current information on water sources.
* Read FarOut comments closely.
* Carry water into dry shelters.
* Whenever you see an active water source, stop, drink all reserves (at least 700 mL), and 
refill. Better safe than sorry.
* "Seeping" water sources can be improved using large leaves and small stones. You'd be 
surprised how much water you can get from these apparently marginal sources.
* When in doubt, carry some extra.
* On the plus side, mud was not a major problem during the drought!

Food
----

I didn't do anything particularly unusual here. I tried hard to maintain my
calories during the trip but found that to be very difficult. From my experience,
the spacing of the towns leaves no reason to be carrying more than 4 days of 
food at any given time.

I lost about 8 pounds during the hike, so obviously I wasn't eating quite enough.

Food Storage
------------

This topic is debated endlessly. I carried a BV450 bear canister and did not 
regret it. Be sure to put reflective tape on your canister and place it on a flat
surface (away from cliffs) at night.

Keep in mind that you don't need to fit your first dinner in the canister, so be
sure to carry out something bulky and caloric after any resupply.

There are cons to the canister:
* The canister adds weight.
* The canister packs awkwardly.
* The canister limits your food carry somewhat.

There are also pros:
* Bear canisters are critter-proof (particularly important inside of shelters
and bear lockers). In my experience on the LT, **critters are a much larger risk than bears.**
* I never spent time in the evening throwing bear lines into trees.
* I never worried about bears and/or other small critters on my trip. I slept soundly.
* The canister limits your food carry somewhat, which prevents over-carrying.

I would guess that 30% of the campsites I stopped at had bear lockers, so that 
makes things a bit easier. Keep in mind that bear lockers are not critter-proof.

Conclusion
----------

Hike the Long Trail end-to-end, you will not regret it.
