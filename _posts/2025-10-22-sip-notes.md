## SIP Handshake Notes

In this testing I used a properly configured SIP phone (.225) and an Asterisk 
server (.102). Here's the sequence, filtered for the SIP traffic.

## RTP Port Traversal Examination

In this testing I used a properly configured SIP phone (.225) and an Asterisk 
server (.102).

Commands used to check firewall:

        sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=allstarlink --list-all

The last command shows that a custom--sip rule had been added, which likely opens
port 5060 for inbound connections from the phone.

The AllStarLink documentation [has some helpful firewall notes here](https://allstarlink.github.io/pi/cockpit-firewall/).

The SIP negotiation happens on UDP port 5060 without any problems.

The final message in the SIP negotiation (OK (INVITE)) assigns UDP port 16314 
to the RTP/media. That is a random server-assigned port inside of the expected 
range of 10,000 to 20,000.

However, that port is **normally 
not open to inbound connections**. Notice the ICMP messages being generated 
in response to the phones RTP messages that 
tell the phone that its messages are being rejected.

But after a few seconds the server finally sends an RTP packet of its own 
to the phone on port 16314. This triggers the firewall hole-punch and no more 
ICMP errors are seen from the firewall.

## Authentication Notes

An initial INVITE message from the phone was rejected by the server with a 
status 401 (Unauthorized). However, this rejection contains this header:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="asterisk",nonce="1761157360/8582866c17ef9e4cfd024254e37cf1e8",opaque="50d273e02ab5c6c3",algorithm=MD5,qop="auth"
```

The format of this header is dictated by [RFC 2617 in section 3.2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617#section-3.2.1).

Digest authentication is requested using the MD5 algorithm.

The subsequent INVITE message from the phone contained this new header:

```
Authorization: Digest username="1001", realm="asterisk", nonce="1761157360/8582866c17ef9e4cfd024254e37cf1e8", qop=auth, cnonce="/68T/KlfvEd3p7T", nc=00000001, opaque="50d273e02ab5c6c3", uri="sip:61057@192.168.8.102:5060;user=phone", response="30ffb4415b99d73da5ef3badee2781d1", algorithm=MD5
```

This particular endpoint was configured (/etc/asterisk/pjsip.conf) with a 
type=auth, auth_type=userpass, username=1001, password=1001.

The critical part of this header is the response attribute which contains
a hash value that allows the client to prove that it knows the password. The 
definition of 
how this hash is computed is provided in [RFC 2617 in section 3.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617#section-3.2.2).

Here's a short Python script that demonstrates the steps to validate
the secret. The request/response match those provided above.

```python
import hashlib
import base64

def MD5(a):
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
    md5_hash.update(a.encode("utf-8"))
    return md5_hash.hexdigest()

# Here is the secret that the client has:
password="1001"

# All of this is contained in the client's request (no 
# secrets here):
realm="asterisk"
username="1001"
uri="sip:61057@192.168.8.102:5060;user=phone"
nonce="1761157360/8582866c17ef9e4cfd024254e37cf1e8"
nc="00000001"
cnonce="/68T/KlfvEd3p7T"
qop="auth"
response="30ffb4415b99d73da5ef3badee2781d1"

# Here we are following the steps outline in RFC 2616 section 3.2.2.1.
# Please see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617#section-3.2.2.1

a1 = username + ":" + realm + ":" + password
a2 = "INVITE" + ":" + uri
secret = MD5(a1) + ":" + nonce + ":" + nc + ":" + cnonce + ":" + qop + ":" + MD5(a2)

# Do we match?
assert(MD5(secret) == response)
```
