IIR Forms
=========

* Direct Form I - the literal implementation of the transfer function. Numerator
applies to inputs (b coefficient) and denominator applies to outputs (a coefficients).
* Direct Form II - reorganized to minimize delays/operations.
* Cascaded Second-Order Sections Form I - Used to improve numerical stability of 
the IIR realization. Filter coefficients are broken into groups of 6.
* Cascaded Second-Order Sections Form II - Reorganized to reduce the number of delays.
