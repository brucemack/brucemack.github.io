_Copyright (C) Bruce MacKinnon, 2025.  Contact info at bottom of the page for comments/corrections._

This module is manufactured by [REYAX Technology Corporation, LTD](https://reyax.com//index.php), based in Taiwan. The [Vendor datasheet is here](https://reyax.com//upload/products_download/download_file/RYLR689.pdf).

The module is based on the [Semtech LLCC68](https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/DS_LLCC68_V10-2.pdf) radio/modem chip.

The module is packaged as a daughter-card with castellated pads for 
SMD mounting on a PCB.

Notes vs SX1276
===============

* Only supports 125, 250, and 500 kHz bandwidths.
* Only supports SF5-9 on 125 kHz, SF5-10 on 250 kHz, and SF5-11 on 500 kHZ.
* LLCC68 has added a BUSY pin. When BUSY is low it indicates that 
the internal state machine is in the idle mode and that the radio is ready
to accept a command from the host.

Driver Notes
============

* At power-up or after reset there is a period during which the chip 
is busy (i.e. BUSY high). Wait for this condition to clear before
sending commands. 
* Calibration is one of the things that is happening during this initial period.
* DIO1 is the generic IRQ line.  Any of the interrupts can be mapped 
to this line.
* FS mode is used for test purposes of the PLL.

KiCad Notes
===========

I've created a KiCad footprint for this module:
