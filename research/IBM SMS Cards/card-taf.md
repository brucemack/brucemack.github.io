[SMS Card Database Entry](https://static.righto.com/sms/TAF.html)

This card provides the 1 MHz oscillator to the entire system. Obviously, a very important 
part of the system.

## SPICE Model

[Working model here](https://github.com/brucemack/IBM-1620/blob/main/sms-cards/cd/ibm-sms-taf.sp)

## Simulated Output

We're getting almost exactly 1 MHz here, which is the expected frequency.
