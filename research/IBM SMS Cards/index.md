Wikipedia has an [overview of the SMS Card Techology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Modular_System).

[This IBM publication](https://ibm-1401.info/Form223-6889-TransistorComponentCircuits.pdf) provides 
in-depth technical information about the SMS cards.

A great source of detailed 
information about individual IBM SMS cards is the 
[incredible blog of Ken Shirriff](https://www.righto.com/2015/03/a-database-of-sms-cards-technology.html). 

I have some some additional analysis/modeling work on some of the 
SMS cards that appear in the [IBM 1620](../IBM-1620). This information
is provided below, keyed by the card ID.
